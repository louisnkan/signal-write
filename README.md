## 🛠️ Usage
1.  **Mount the Vault:** Enter your Gemini API key in the settings.
2.  **Draft Raw:** Write without self-censorship.
3.  **Select Tone:** Professional, Concise, Empathetic, or Persuasive.
4.  **Ghost It:** Let the engine refine the draft.

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **Engine:** Gemini 1.5 Flash
- **Framework:** Tailwind JIT + Vanilla JS
- **Security:** AES-style LocalStorage persistence (BYOK)
